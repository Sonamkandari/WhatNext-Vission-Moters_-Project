# Navigation Items
Choose the items to include in the app, and arrange the order in which they appear. Users can personalize the navigation to add or move items, but users can't remove or rename the items that you add. Some navigation items are available only for phone or only for desktop. These items are dropped from the navigation bar when the app is viewed in a format that the item doesnâ€™t support
